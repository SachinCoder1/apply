# üìù DotPassport

## üåü Project Overview

**Tagline:**
*Your on-chain identity and reputation layer for the Polkadot ecosystem.*

**Description:**
DotPassport is a Polkadot-native identity and reputation protocol that enables users to build a portable, verifiable profile of their on-chain activity and ecosystem contributions. Users earn badges and trust signals by participating in staking, governance, DAOs, NFTs, LPs, and more. dApps and parachains can integrate DotPassport to personalize experiences, gate access, or deliver targeted rewards based on user reputation and **Sybil resistance** signals.

**Polkadot Integration:**
Built entirely on Polkadot-native infrastructure, DotPassport leverages the identity pallet, DIDs, and XCM to aggregate cross-chain activity and issue meaningful, verifiable credentials. It is designed to be composable, extensible, and easily integrated by any dApp in the Polkadot ecosystem.

**Why this project:**
Other ecosystems like Ethereum have Gitcoin Passport, Sismo, and Proof of Humanity to anchor user identity and contribution history. Polkadot lacks a unified, user-facing reputation and identity layer that works across parachains. DotPassport fills this critical gap in a way that's user-friendly and developer-ready.

## üîç Project Details

**Tech Stack:**

* Smart Contracts / Pallet: ink! or Substrate pallet
* Indexer: Subquery or Subsquid
* Frontend: React, TypeScript, Polkadot.js
* DID integration: Identity pallet or KILT (optional)

**Core Components:**

* Reputation engine to issue badges based on on-chain behavior
* User profile and badge explorer
* Developer SDK and REST API
* Public dashboard to display user activity, badges, and trust level

**Not included (in v1):**

* Cross-ecosystem (non-Polkadot) data integration
* Biometric KYC

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

**Fit into Polkadot:**
DotPassport adds a missing identity and reputation layer to the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling more personalized, contextual dApp experiences. It encourages deeper user engagement by helping parachains and apps understand who their users are and reward meaningful activity.

**Target Audience:**

* dApp developers looking to personalize UX or rewards
* Parachains running quests, mints, events, or gated actions
* Wallets and explorers looking to enrich user profiles
* Users seeking to build a persistent, portable Web3 identity

**Similar Projects:**

* Gitcoin Passport (Ethereum) ‚Äì focuses on social + Web2 + ZK signals
* Sismo (Ethereum) ‚Äì ZK badge platform
* KILT (Polkadot) ‚Äì credential issuance protocol
* True Network ‚Äì attestation infra

**Why DotPassport is unique:**

* Focuses on real usage-based reputation and trust signals
* Designed for broad dApp integration from day one
* Includes **Sybil resistance** scoring as part of the core profile
* Native to Polkadot‚Äôs identity, governance, and staking stack
* While other projects focuses on credential issuance and identity verification, DotPassport is focused on usage-based reputation, making it ideal for gamified experiences, community incentives, and dApp personalization and ease of use.
